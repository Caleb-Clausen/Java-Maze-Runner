# Java-Maze-Runner
# The Main method is in the MazeRunner.java  file, compile this file then run its class file.
# After all file have complied you need to select a new maze to have the program run through
# Testing code here examples would be this following command on the cmd line  ---Java MazeRunner "fork1" "recursive" 
# The "fork1" string arg is a text file that the MazeRunner class uses to select the text file
# The "recursive" string arg is the method that the computer will use to find the cheese in the maze
