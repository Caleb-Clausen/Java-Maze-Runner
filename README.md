3. Type “javac MazeRunner.java” in the command line.

* Maze Runner Summery
This program takes a text file, turns it into a 2D array and uses two different searching methods to search the 2D array. In this case the starting point of the Maze is a mouse represented by an “M” character. The mouse then searches until it finds the cheese represented by a “C” on the map. The console outputs an array value of each direction used to find the cheese such as “north”, “south”, “west”, “east” and a text representation of the path with “.”.
